# Error Handling in My Project

In my project, I have implemented global error handling using promises and higher-order functions. This approach ensures that errors are managed consistently across the application, providing a better user experience and easier debugging.

## API Documentation

For more information about the API and its endpoints, you can refer to the Swagger documentation I created:

[API Documentation](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)

Feel free to explore the API and see how error handling is implemented throughout the application!
